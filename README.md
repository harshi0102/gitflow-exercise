Clone the newly created repository to your local machine.
Add a new branch named dev(alternative names: development, develop).
Make sure that the dev branch is pushed to GitHub.
git push --set-upstream origin dev
Make the dev branch the default branch.
Create a feature branch called add-quotes

Add a solve.txt file with the following sentence:
"First, solve the problem. Then, write the code." â€“ John Johnson
Add another test.txt file. It should be empty.
Commit all files to your feature branch.
Push your changes to GitHub.
Open a new pull request from add-quotes into dev.
Make sure that you want to merge your commits into dev branch. You should add a comment in your opened pull request that is similar to this one:
